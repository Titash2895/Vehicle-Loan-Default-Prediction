# PROBLEM STATEMENT
Identify the possibility of defaulting on the loan payments, thereby making it easier for financial institutes to verify an individual and minimise the risk of bad debts. 

This is important as stringent criteria were developed which has now led to more number of rejections therefore hampering the lending business. 

The additional value that this algorithm will provide is:

Quick processing of loan for approval by the bank.

Help with reducing the rejection rates of capable candidates therefore increasing the profitability and goodwill of the financial institute.
